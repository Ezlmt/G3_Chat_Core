The program was translated using [Whisper](https://github.com/Const-me/Whisper), and the source code can be found in the previous project. The model format is GGML, which is the same as the Android deployment, so you'll need to convert the model format before you can use it.

## Convert model

1. To start by cloning the Whisper native source code, as we need some of its files, run the following command from the root of the `whisper-finetune` project.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```

2. To convert your models, run `convert-ggml.py` from the root of your `Whisper-Finetune` project to convert your models to ggml format for your Android project. The models you need to convert can be original Transformers. It can also be a fine-tuned model.
```shell
python convert-ggml.py --model_dir=models/whisper-tiny-finetune/ --whisper_dir=whisper/ --output_path=models/whisper-tiny-finetune-ggml.bin
```
